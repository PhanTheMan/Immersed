<h3>What is Immersed?</h3>
<p>
Immersed is a web application that offers immersive, kid-friendly, and safe cyber security training. It provides users with realistic consequences for violating good cyber security practices and specific feedback based on their actions, helping to create strong recall of the training experience. Unlike traditional cyber security training methods, Immersed offers a complete set of passive and active training situations that are interactive, isolated, and relatable to children, making it an effective and comprehensive training tool.

<h3>Why can't I access all of the code for Immersed?</h3>
<p>
As Immersed is currently in its Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage, I am unable to provide full access to the proprietary code. However, I am happy to share select code snippets from my contributions to the project.

<h3>What was my role in the project?</h3>

<p>
As a key member of the team, I oversaw the implementation of both the system administrator view of the survey landing page and the user view of taking the survey.
